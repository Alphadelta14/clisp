/* Platforms that lack mbsinit() also lack mbrlen(), mbrtowc(), mbsrtowcs()
   and wcrtomb(), wcsrtombs().
   We assume that
     - sizeof (mbstate_t) >= 4,
     - only stateless encodings are supported (such as UTF-8 and EUC-JP, but
       not ISO-2022 variants),
     - for each encoding, the number of bytes for a wide character is <= 4.
       (This maximum is attained for UTF-8, GB18030, EUC-TW.)
   We define the meaning of mbstate_t as follows:
     - In mb -> wc direction, mbstate_t's first byte contains the number of
       buffered bytes (in the range 0..3), followed by up to 3 buffered bytes.
       See mbrtowc.c.
     - In wc -> mb direction, mbstate_t contains no information. In other
       words, it is always in the initial state.  */
